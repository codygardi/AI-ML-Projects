    "# Natural Language Processing (NLP): Sentiment Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we’ll perform **Sentiment Analysis** — a foundational task in NLP that determines whether a piece of text expresses a **positive**, **negative**, or **neutral** opinion.  \n",
    "We’ll use three approaches to show the evolution of NLP models:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Naive Bayes** — a simple statistical model that assumes word independence.  \n",
    "2. **Logistic Regression** — a linear classifier that uses word frequencies or TF-IDF features.  \n",
    "3. **Transformer (BERT)** — a pre-trained deep learning model that understands context at the sentence level.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to classify text reviews and compare how traditional machine learning stacks up against modern transformers built with **PyTorch**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset Description\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dataset Name:** IMDb Movie Reviews Dataset  \n",
    "**Source:** [Kaggle IMDb Dataset of 50K Movie Reviews](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews)  \n",
    "**Size:** 50,000 labeled reviews (balanced 25K positive, 25K negative)  \n",
    "**Target Variable:** `sentiment` (values: *positive* or *negative*)\n",
    "\n",
    "Each review contains raw English text written by users.  \n",
    "We’ll preprocess the data (clean text, tokenize, and remove stopwords), vectorize it using TF-IDF, and then train and evaluate the models.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective and Predictions\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective is to **predict sentiment polarity** based on review text.  \n",
    "We’ll compare:\n",
    "- Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score of each model.  \n",
    "- Model interpretability (which words drive predictions).  \n",
    "- Training speed and computational efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hypothesized Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Naive Bayes** will perform surprisingly well for its simplicity, reaching ~85–88% accuracy.  \n",
    "2. **Logistic Regression** will outperform Naive Bayes slightly, as it better models correlated word features.  \n",
    "3. **BERT (PyTorch)** will achieve the best accuracy (~93–96%) by understanding context, negations, and tone.\n",

    "| **Logistic Regression** | Improves on Naive Bayes by weighting words more flexibly. |\n",
    "| **BERT (Transformer)** | Understands full sentence meaning and context; ideal for nuanced human language. |\n",
    "\n",
    "In simple terms:\n",
    "- Naive Bayes counts word probabilities.\n",
    "- Logistic Regression balances words mathematically.\n",
    "- BERT *understands* what you mean.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Naive Bayes** performed solidly for its simplicity — it’s still an excellent baseline for text classification.  \n",
    "- **Logistic Regression** delivered the best results here, likely due to the strong TF-IDF features and limited BERT fine-tuning (only two epochs and 10K samples).  \n",
    "- **BERT** underperformed slightly in this small-sample test because fine-tuning large language models requires **more data and training time** to fully adapt to the task.\n",

    "\n",
    "### 🧠 Interpreting the Results (as if explaining to high school students)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Naive Bayes** is like counting positive and negative words — if a review says “amazing” a lot, it probably likes the movie.  \n",
    "- **Logistic Regression** is smarter — it doesn’t just count; it *learns which words matter more.* It knows that “not bad” isn’t the same as “bad.”  \n",
    "- **BERT** reads the review like a person. It doesn’t rely on counting words — it actually *understands context*. But just like a human, it needs more “reading practice” (training) to get really good.\n",

    "### ⚙️ Why the Results Make Sense\n",
    "\n",
    "| Factor | Impact |\n",
    "|---------|--------|\n",
    "| **Limited BERT fine-tuning (10K samples, 2 epochs)** | Not enough time to adapt; underfitting likely. |\n",
    "| **TF-IDF strength for classical models** | Preprocessed word frequencies captured most sentiment clues. |\n",
    "| **Dataset balance** | With 50/50 positive/negative reviews, simpler models already perform well. |\n",
    "| **GPU/epoch constraints** | BERT benefits significantly from longer fine-tuning (3–5 epochs, full 50K samples). |\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔧 How to Improve BERT for Better Results\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Fine-tune on full dataset (50K samples)** for at least 3–4 epochs.  \n",
    "2. **Use DistilBERT or RoBERTa** — smaller, faster models often match full BERT accuracy on sentiment tasks.  \n",
    "3. **Add learning rate warmup and gradient clipping** for stability.  \n",
    "4. **Use mixed precision training (AMP)** if running on GPU for faster convergence.  \n",
    "5. **Include data augmentation** (e.g., synonym replacement, random word swap) to expose BERT to more phrasing diversity.\n",
